 I'll explain the MongoDB Persistent Volume (PV) concept in the context of a StatefulSet, using a more detailed example. This will help illustrate how StatefulSets manage persistent storage for each MongoDB instance in a replica set.

Let's create a MongoDB replica set with three nodes using a StatefulSet. We'll go through the process step-by-step:

1. Storage Class
First, we need to define a Storage Class that will be used to dynamically provision Persistent Volumes:

```yaml
apiVersion: storage.k8s.io/v1
kind: StorageClass
metadata:
  name: fast
provisioner: kubernetes.io/gce-pd
parameters:
  type: pd-ssd
```

This StorageClass uses SSDs for better performance.

2. Headless Service
We need a headless service to provide network identity to the StatefulSet pods:

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: mongodb
  labels:
    app: mongodb
spec:
  ports:
  - port: 27017
    targetPort: 27017
  clusterIP: None
  selector:
    app: mongodb
```

3. StatefulSet
Now, let's define the StatefulSet for MongoDB:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: mongodb
spec:
  serviceName: "mongodb"
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: mongodb
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: mongodb
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: mongodb
        image: mongo:4.2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 27017
        volumeMounts:
        - name: data
          mountPath: /data/db
  volumeClaimTemplates:
  - metadata:
      name: data
    spec:
      accessModes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ]
      storageClassName: "fast"
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 10Gi
```

Let's break down the PV concept in this StatefulSet:

1. volumeClaimTemplates:
   This section defines a template for Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs). The StatefulSet will create one PVC for each pod.

2. PVC Naming:
   The StatefulSet will create PVCs with names following the pattern: 
   `<volumeClaimTemplate-name>-<statefulset-name>-<ordinal>`
   In this case: data-mongodb-0, data-mongodb-1, data-mongodb-2

3. Storage Class:
   The PVC uses the "fast" StorageClass we defined earlier, which will provision SSD-based Persistent Volumes.

4. Access Mode:
   ReadWriteOnce means the volume can be mounted as read-write by a single node.

5. Storage Size:
   Each PVC requests 10Gi of storage.

6. Volume Mounts:
   In the container spec, we mount the volume named "data" to "/data/db", which is where MongoDB stores its data.

When you create this StatefulSet, here's what happens:

1. Three pods are created: mongodb-0, mongodb-1, and mongodb-2.
2. For each pod, a PVC is created: data-mongodb-0, data-mongodb-1, and data-mongodb-2.
3. The storage provisioner (in this case, GCE PD) creates a Persistent Volume for each PVC.
4. Each pod mounts its respective PV to /data/db.

Key benefits of this setup:

1. Stable Storage: Each MongoDB instance has its own dedicated storage that persists across pod rescheduling or restarts.

2. Data Persistence: If a pod is deleted and recreated, it will reattach to the same PV, ensuring data persistence.

3. Independent Scaling: You can scale up or down the StatefulSet, and each new pod will get its own PV.

4. Ordered Operations: Pods are created in order (0, 1, 2) and deleted in reverse order, which is crucial for MongoDB replica set operations.

5. Network Identity: Each pod gets a stable hostname (mongodb-0.mongodb, mongodb-1.mongodb, mongodb-2.mongodb), which is essential for MongoDB replica set configuration.

This setup ensures that each MongoDB instance in the replica set has its own dedicated, persistent storage, while also maintaining the necessary stable network identity and ordered operations that a MongoDB replica set requires. The StatefulSet manages all of this automatically, making it much easier to run stateful applications like MongoDB in Kubernetes.
