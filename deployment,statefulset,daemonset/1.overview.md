In Kubernetes, Deployments, StatefulSets, and DaemonSets are different types of workload controllers used to manage and scale applications. Let's explore each of these concepts with examples:

1. Deployment:
A Deployment is the most common way to deploy stateless applications in Kubernetes. It manages a set of identical pods, ensuring that a specified number of replicas are running at all times.

Key features:
- Provides declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets
- Supports rolling updates and rollbacks
- Suitable for stateless applications

Example:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: nginx:1.14.2
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

This Deployment creates three replicas of an Nginx web server.

2. StatefulSet:
A StatefulSet is used for applications that require stable, unique network identifiers, stable persistent storage, and ordered deployment and scaling.

Key features:
- Provides stable, unique network identifiers
- Provides stable, persistent storage
- Supports ordered, graceful deployment and scaling
- Suitable for stateful applications like databases

Example:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: StatefulSet
metadata:
  name: web
spec:
  serviceName: "nginx"
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: nginx
        image: k8s.gcr.io/nginx-slim:0.8
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
          name: web
  volumeClaimTemplates:
  - metadata:
      name: www
    spec:
      accessModes: [ "ReadWriteOnce" ]
      resources:
        requests:
          storage: 1Gi
```

This StatefulSet creates three replicas of an Nginx web server with stable network identifiers and persistent storage.

3. DaemonSet:
A DaemonSet ensures that all (or some) nodes in a cluster run a copy of a Pod. As nodes are added or removed from the cluster, the DaemonSet automatically adds or removes Pods.

Key features:
- Runs a copy of a Pod on each node (or a subset of nodes)
- Automatically adds Pods to new nodes and removes from deleted nodes
- Suitable for node-level operations, like log collection or monitoring

Example:
```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: DaemonSet
metadata:
  name: fluentd-elasticsearch
  namespace: kube-system
  labels:
    k8s-app: fluentd-logging
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      name: fluentd-elasticsearch
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        name: fluentd-elasticsearch
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: fluentd-elasticsearch
        image: quay.io/fluentd_elasticsearch/fluentd:v2.5.2
        resources:
          limits:
            memory: 200Mi
          requests:
            cpu: 100m
            memory: 200Mi
```

This DaemonSet runs a Fluentd logging agent on every node in the cluster.

In summary:
- Use Deployments for stateless applications
- Use StatefulSets for stateful applications that require stable network identities and persistent storage
- Use DaemonSets for node-level operations that need to run on all or a subset of nodes

Each of these controllers serves a specific purpose and helps in managing different types of workloads in a Kubernetes cluster.
