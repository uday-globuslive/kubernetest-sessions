In Kubernetes, an Ingress resource can route traffic to different services based on the hostname or the URL path (prefix routing). Let's break down the differences and provide examples.

## Hostname Routing
Hostname-based routing directs traffic to a specific service based on the domain name (hostname) in the request. This is useful when you have multiple services running in the same Kubernetes cluster and want to serve them under different domain names.

### Example:
  - Domain 1: app1.example.com
  - Domain 2: app2.example.com

You can configure the Ingress to route requests to different services based on the hostname:
```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: hostname-routing-example
spec:
  rules:
  - host: app1.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: app1-service
            port:
              number: 80
  - host: app2.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: app2-service
            port:
              number: 80
```

In this example:

- Requests to app1.example.com will be routed to app1-service.
- Requests to app2.example.com will be routed to app2-service.

Prefix Routing
Prefix-based routing directs traffic to different services based on the URL path. This is useful when you want to serve multiple services under the same domain but with different URL paths.

Example:

- Path 1: /app1/
- Path 2: /app2/
You can configure the Ingress to route requests to different services based on the URL path:

```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: prefix-routing-example
spec:
  rules:
  - host: example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /app1/
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: app1-service
            port:
              number: 80
      - path: /app2/
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: app2-service
            port:
              number: 80
```

In this example:

- Requests to example.com/app1/ will be routed to app1-service.
- Requests to example.com/app2/ will be routed to app2-service.

## Combined Example: Hostname and Prefix Routing
You can combine hostname and prefix routing within the same Ingress resource:
```
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: combined-routing-example
spec:
  rules:
  - host: app1.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /api/
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: app1-api-service
            port:
              number: 80
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: app1-web-service
            port:
              number: 80
  - host: app2.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: app2-service
            port:
              number: 80
```

In this example:

- Requests to app1.example.com/api/ will be routed to app1-api-service.
- Requests to app1.example.com/ will be routed to app1-web-service.
- Requests to app2.example.com/ will be routed to app2-service.

Key Differences
- Hostname Routing: Routes based on the domain name (e.g., app1.example.com vs. app2.example.com).
- Prefix Routing: Routes based on the URL path (e.g., /app1/ vs. /app2/).
These routing methods allow you to efficiently manage and serve multiple services under the same or different domains.
