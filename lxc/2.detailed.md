- Below image shows difference between VMs, LXC containers and Docker containers.
![VM,LXC,Docker](images/IMG_1548.PNG)

- Unlike VM, the complete RAM of hostmachine will be available to LXC container but only uses required portion of it, instead of completely allocating it. We can set a limit also for that.

- Most commonly used LXC commands while using it.

## In lxc containers, if it is using kernel of hostmachine, how centos container running on ubuntu hostmachine?
When you run a CentOS container on an Ubuntu host using LXC (or Docker), the container indeed shares the host's kernel, but it can still appear to be running a different operating system like CentOS. This is possible because of the way containers work:

Userland Separation: The container includes its own userland, which consists of all the programs, libraries, and configuration files that are part of the CentOS distribution. This gives the container the look and feel of CentOS, even though it's using the Ubuntu host's kernel.

Compatibility: The Linux kernel is designed to be fairly backward-compatible, meaning that many different Linux distributions can share the same kernel version. Since containers are essentially isolated environments with their own filesystem, libraries, and binaries, they can simulate the environment of a different OS distribution (like CentOS) while still using the host’s kernel.

Container Filesystem: When you launch a CentOS container on an Ubuntu host, what you're actually doing is using a CentOS root filesystem. This filesystem contains all the typical CentOS tools, libraries, and configurations, making the environment behave as though it is CentOS.

Namespaces and Cgroups: Containers use Linux kernel features like namespaces and cgroups to isolate processes, users, filesystems, and network interfaces. This isolation makes it appear as though the processes in the container are running on a CentOS system.

In essence, the container doesn’t require its own kernel to replicate the CentOS environment. It just needs the CentOS userland tools and libraries to create an environment that behaves like CentOS, even though it’s running on an Ubuntu kernel.

- For installing LXC, I followed this official documentation [link](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxc/getting-started/)
  - on ubuntu:
    ```bash
    sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
    sudo apt install -y lxc
    ```

- After that, you can check installation done succesfull or not:
  - client/cli: ```which lxc```
  - daemon/runtime: ```which lxd```
  - To check packages installed on debian based distro, should display lxd and lxd-client: ```dpkg -l | grep lxd```
 
- Next steps of configuration:
  - To list groups on the linux host machine: ```groups```
  - User should be added to lxd group: ```sudo gpasswd -a $USER lxd```
  -  To check groups  added to user: ```id $USER```
  - To check user added to that group: ```getent group lxd```
  - To reload permissions: ```newgrp lxd```
 
- Initialize lxd on the linux machine:
  ```
  sudo lxd init

lxc storage list

To start your first container, try: lxc launch ubuntu:20.04
Or for a virtual machine: lxc launch ubuntu:20.04 --vm

```

- To launch a container: ```lxc launch ubuntu:16.04``` or ```lxc launch images:centos/7 kmaster --profile k8s```
- To list running containers: ```lxc list```
- To stop a container: ```lxc stop container_name```
- To start a stopped container: ```lxc start container_name```
- To delete a stopped container: ```lxc delete container_name```
- To stop and delete a running container: ```lxc delete --force container_name```
- To clone a container: ```lxc copy myubuntu myanotherubuntu```
- To connect to the shell of container: ```lxc exec myvm bash```
- Connect to shell using run as user option: ```lxc exec myanotherubuntu su - ubuntu```
- Run a bash script: ```cat shellscript.sh | lxc exec container_name bash```
- Other containers can be accessed from one of your lxc container using its dns: <containername>.lxd, check with ping command.
- To get complete statistic of a container: ```lxc info myvm | less```
- To see the configuration of a container: ```lxc config show myvm | less```

## In the command lxc launch --vm, why this --vm is for?
The --vm flag in the lxc launch command is used to specify that you want to launch a virtual machine (VM) rather than a container.

LXC (Linux Containers) traditionally operates with containers, which are lightweight and share the host system's kernel. However, with the --vm flag, LXC uses the LXD hypervisor to create and manage virtual machines, which have their own kernel and are more isolated from the host system.

Here's what the --vm flag does:

- Isolation: VMs are more isolated than containers, as they have their own kernel and can run a completely different operating system from the host.
- Use Case: You might choose to launch a VM instead of a container if you need more isolation, need to run a different kernel, or want to run an operating system that requires its own kernel.
- Resource Usage: VMs typically require more resources (CPU, memory) compared to containers because they include a full operating system.
In short, the --vm flag tells LXC to create a virtual machine instead of a container, giving you the benefits and characteristics of a VM.


## Profiles
- To show profiles: ```lxc profile list```
- To see details of a particular profile: ```lxc profile show default```
- To create new profile: ```lxc profile create custom```
- To copy from existing profile and create new one: ```lxc profile copy default k8s```

## Limits
- To set limits at container level: ```lxc config set myvm limits.memory 512MB```
- To set limit at profile level, which might require container re-creation, you can edit the profile: ```lxc profile edit default```
  ![profile config](images/IMG_1581.PNG)

## file transfer
- To copy file from host machine to container: ```lxc file push myfile myvm2/root/```
- To copy file from container to host machine: ```lxc file pull myvm2/root/myfile .```
- Can use scp with the container ip address: ```scp root@conainer_ip:/etc/kubernetes/admin.conf ~/.kube/config```

## snapshots
- To create snapshot of a container: ```lxc snapshot myvm2 snap1```
- The above snapshot will create a new image: ```lxc image list```
- To restore snaphost: ```lxc restore myvm2 snap1```

## Nested containers:
- By default creation of containers inside containers is disabled, enable it by running below commands.
  ```
  lxc stop myvm2
  lxc config set myvm2 security.privileged true
  lxc config set myvm2 security.nesting true
  ```

- Or set at profile level, in a new profile.
  ```
  lxc profile create custom
  lxc profile edit custom
  ## In the profile editor
  ```

- Once you initialize the lxd inside the container, lxc list will show another bridged ip in the container.
