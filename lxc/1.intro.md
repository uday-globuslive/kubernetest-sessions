 I'll provide you with a comprehensive overview of LXC (Linux Containers) along with examples. As a beginner, this will give you a solid foundation to understand and work with LXC containers.

1. Introduction to LXC:
LXC (Linux Containers) is an operating system-level virtualization technology that allows you to run multiple isolated Linux systems (containers) on a single host. Unlike traditional virtual machines, LXC containers share the host's kernel, making them lightweight and fast.

2. Key Concepts:

a) Container: An isolated environment that runs on the host system, sharing the host's kernel but with its own filesystem, network, and process space.

b) Image: A template used to create containers, containing a basic filesystem and configuration.

c) Host: The physical or virtual machine running the LXC software and hosting the containers.

3. Installation:
To get started with LXC, you need to install it on your host system. On Ubuntu or Debian-based systems, you can use:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install lxc lxc-templates
```

4. Creating Containers:
To create a new container, use the lxc-create command:

```
sudo lxc-create -n mycontainer -t ubuntu
```

This creates a new container named "mycontainer" using the Ubuntu template.

5. Starting and Stopping Containers:
To start a container:
```
sudo lxc-start -n mycontainer
```

To stop a container:
```
sudo lxc-stop -n mycontainer
```

6. Accessing Containers:
You can access a running container using:
```
sudo lxc-attach -n mycontainer
```

7. Container Configuration:
LXC containers are configured using configuration files. The main configuration file is located at /var/lib/lxc/[container-name]/config. You can edit this file to modify container settings like network configuration, resource limits, etc.

Example of adding a network interface to a container:
```
lxc.network.type = veth
lxc.network.link = lxcbr0
lxc.network.flags = up
lxc.network.hwaddr = 00:16:3e:xx:xx:xx
```

8. Container Networking:
LXC supports various networking modes:

a) Bridge mode: Containers get an IP on the same network as the host.
b) NAT mode: Containers get a private IP, and the host acts as a NAT gateway.
c) Macvlan: Containers get their own MAC address on the physical network.

Example of setting up bridge networking:
```
sudo lxc-create -n mycontainer -t ubuntu -- -n eth0
```

9. Resource Limits:
You can set resource limits for containers in the configuration file:

```
lxc.cgroup.memory.limit_in_bytes = 512M
lxc.cgroup.cpu.shares = 512
```

10. Snapshotting and Cloning:
LXC allows you to create snapshots of containers and clone them:

Creating a snapshot:
```
sudo lxc-snapshot -n mycontainer
```

Cloning a container:
```
sudo lxc-copy -n mycontainer -N myclone
```

11. Security:
LXC uses various security features like AppArmor, SELinux, and seccomp to isolate containers. You can enhance security by:

- Using unprivileged containers
- Limiting capabilities
- Using MAC (Mandatory Access Control) systems

12. LXC vs LXD:
LXD is a next-generation system container manager that offers a better user experience and additional features on top of LXC. It's worth exploring once you're comfortable with LXC basics.

13. Practical Example:
Let's create a web server container:

```
# Create the container
sudo lxc-create -n webserver -t ubuntu

# Start the container
sudo lxc-start -n webserver

# Attach to the container
sudo lxc-attach -n webserver

# Inside the container, install Apache
apt-get update
apt-get install apache2

# Exit the container
exit

# Get the container's IP
sudo lxc-info -n webserver -iH

# Access the web server from the host
curl http://<container-ip>
```
