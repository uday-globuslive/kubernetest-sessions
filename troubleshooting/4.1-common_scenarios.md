I'll provide you with several common Kubernetes troubleshooting scenarios, along with sample YAML files, error descriptions, and general troubleshooting approaches. Let's go through a few different scenarios:

1. Pod in CrashLoopBackOff state

Scenario: A pod is repeatedly crashing and restarting.

Sample YAML (deployment.yaml):

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: crashloop-demo
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: crashloop-demo
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: crashloop-demo
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: crashloop-container
        image: busybox
        command: ["/bin/sh", "-c", "echo Hello && exit 1"]
```

Error: The container exits with a non-zero exit code, causing the pod to restart continuously.

Troubleshooting approach:
1. Check pod status: `kubectl get pods`
2. Describe the pod: `kubectl describe pod <pod-name>`
3. Check pod logs: `kubectl logs <pod-name>`
4. If needed, check previous container logs: `kubectl logs <pod-name> --previous`

Fix: Modify the command to exit with a zero exit code or fix the underlying issue causing the crash.

2. Service not routing traffic to pods

Scenario: A service is not directing traffic to the intended pods.

Sample YAML (service.yaml):

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-app
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 8080
```

Error: The service selector doesn't match the pod labels.

Troubleshooting approach:
1. Check service details: `kubectl describe service my-service`
2. Verify pod labels: `kubectl get pods --show-labels`
3. Check endpoints: `kubectl get endpoints my-service`

Fix: Ensure that the service selector matches the pod labels.

3. Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) stuck in Pending state

Scenario: A PVC remains in a Pending state and doesn't bind to a PV.

Sample YAML (pvc.yaml):

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
metadata:
  name: my-pvc
spec:
  accessModes:
    - ReadWriteOnce
  resources:
    requests:
      storage: 5Gi
  storageClassName: my-storage-class
```

Error: The specified storage class doesn't exist or no matching PV is available.

Troubleshooting approach:
1. Check PVC status: `kubectl get pvc`
2. Describe the PVC: `kubectl describe pvc my-pvc`
3. List available storage classes: `kubectl get storageclass`
4. Check available PVs: `kubectl get pv`

Fix: Ensure the specified storage class exists and has available PVs, or create a matching PV manually.

4. Ingress not routing traffic

Scenario: An Ingress resource is not properly routing traffic to services.

Sample YAML (ingress.yaml):

```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  name: my-ingress
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: nginx
spec:
  rules:
  - host: myapp.example.com
    http:
      paths:
      - path: /
        pathType: Prefix
        backend:
          service:
            name: my-service
            port: 
              number: 80
```

Error: The Ingress controller is not installed or the service name is incorrect.

Troubleshooting approach:
1. Check Ingress status: `kubectl get ingress`
2. Describe the Ingress: `kubectl describe ingress my-ingress`
3. Verify Ingress controller is running: `kubectl get pods -n ingress-nginx`
4. Check service existence: `kubectl get service my-service`

Fix: Install the Ingress controller if missing, or correct the service name in the Ingress resource.

5. ConfigMap not updating in pods

Scenario: Changes to a ConfigMap are not reflected in the pods using it.

Sample YAML (configmap.yaml):

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: my-config
data:
  APP_COLOR: blue
